Maybe 2025 wasn't the year of Linux on the desktop globally, but it was my year of the Linux desktop.
After years of working only with Windows every day, I finally made the switch to Linux as my primary operating system.

As a result, no ads, no reboots every week, no Microsoft Copilot, and no regrets.
Finally, I am the one who controls my computer.

2026 will be the year of self-hosting.
